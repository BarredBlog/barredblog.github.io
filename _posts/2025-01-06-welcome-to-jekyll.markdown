When I am at work on a bright sunny day, there is nothing I'd rather be doing than sitting outside and taking pictures. Luckily, with the power of technology I can do both!

Above is a motion activated camera trigger from camtraptions. If we pair this with any camera that allows remote triggering (in my case, a canon eos rebel T7) and the optional Camtraptions remote receiver (You can just use a wire otherwise)
