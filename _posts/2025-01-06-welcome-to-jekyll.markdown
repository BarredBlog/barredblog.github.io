When I am at work on a bright sunny day, there is nothing I'd rather be doing than sitting outside and taking pictures. Luckily, with the power of technology I can do both!

Above is a motion activated camera trigger from camtraptions. If we pair this with any camera that allows remote triggering (in my case, a canon eos rebel T7) and the optional Camtraptions remote receiver (You can just use a wire otherwise)

The concept of what we are doing here is simple. Set up your motion sensor in a place you know your target will approach, when it detects motion it will trigger your camera to take pictures. 

The main benefits to this technique are that your motion sensor can trigger your camera for most of the day and that you can get much closer to your subjects. 

At the end of the day, I will have anywhere from 4000 to 8000 photots to sift through and the majority of them won't even have the subject in view. Of those thousands, there will be a couple that will make sifting through all of them worth your while
